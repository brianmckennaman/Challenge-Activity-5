# Challenge-Activity-5

The purpose of this activity was to add 3rd party API functionality to pre-existing code.

First, I created time blocks in the calendar using html, then added styling to them using bootstrap.

Next, I added moment.js functionality by displaying the current day at the top of the page, and then by dynamically changing the colors of the timeblocks according to the current hour using moment.js.

Then, I added local storage functionality to the textareas by saving the user input into the local storage and retrieving it so it is not erased when refreshing the page.
